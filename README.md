# WackyPyWebM
Python implementation of [OIRNOIR's WackyWebM](https://github.com/OIRNOIR/WackyWebM)

Currently supported modes:
- audiobounce
- audioshutter
- bounce
- shrink
- sporadic
- shutter

I plan to implement other modes that are supported by the original in the near future. 

If you you want to contribute and implement the some of the modes yourself feel free to fork this project and create a PR. Thanks


I recommend using Python 3.8+

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
